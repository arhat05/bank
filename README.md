# banking app/finance manager

working on creating a mock bank portal that allows users to register, login, and view their account information, along with transaction history for their accounts.
users can also transfer money between their accounts, and deposit/withdraw money from their accounts.

additionally, users can see promotions(for the purpose of this project, they are not real) that are currently running based on their top spending categories.

future plans include:
- adding a budgeting feature
- adding a stock trading feature
- adding data visualization for spending habits, along with a breakdown of spending categories
- adding spending insights based on spending habits, and tips they can better manage their money
- tracking user's net worth over time
- adding a savings goal feature
- transfer money to other users, and to other accounts
